        ----------
        bounds : list of tuples or list of grAdapt.space.datatype.base

        x_history : array-like (2d)
            History points. Consider those to prevent sampling in dense regions.

        Returns
        -------
        array-like (n, len(bounds))
            Returns a 2D array. dim is the dimension of a single point
            Each row corresponds to a single point.
            Each column corresponds to a dimension.
